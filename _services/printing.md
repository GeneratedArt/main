# General overview

Printing XY plotters and 3D printers are popular techniques used to create generative art for exhibitions. The XY plotters can print on a wide range of surfaces, such as paper, cardboard, vinyl, fabric, leather, wood, metal, and plastics. This allows for unique and captivating pieces to be created for display. 3D printers can be used to create sculptures or other 3D pieces using various materials, such as PETG, PLA, TPU, and wood. These techniques provide endless possibilities for creating interactive and immersive experiences for art enthusiasts and audiences.

## XY plots

XY plots using plotters are a popular technique for creating generative art, where machines use a pen or other tool to draw or paint on any surface based on digital input. We offer a unique service of high-quality printing for generative art created using XY plotting, using advanced robotic arms to print on any surface and with a range of tools including pens, paint, and scratching tools in full color. Currently, we provide A3 format prints of the highest quality thanks to our technical expertise and attention to detail. Our printing services are perfect for artists looking to bring their XY plots to life or art enthusiasts looking to add a unique and captivating piece to their collection.

### File formats

All image file formats are accepted.

### Surfaces

XY plotters can print on a wide range of surfaces, including paper, cardboard, vinyl, fabric, leather, wood, metal, and plastics. The type of surface used will depend on the specific application and the requirements of the artwork being created. Some surfaces may require special preparation or treatment before printing to ensure optimal adhesion and print quality, while others may be incompatible with certain types of ink or printing methods. It's important to carefully consider the surface and printing materials when designing and creating generative art using an XY plotter.

## 3d sculptures

3D generative sculptures can be created using algorithmic design techniques and then fabricated using 3D printing technology. This allows for the creation of intricate and complex structures that would be difficult or impossible to create using traditional sculpting methods. These sculptures can be displayed as standalone pieces of art or incorporated into larger installations for generative art exhibitions. Additionally, 3D printing allows for the easy replication of sculptures, making it possible to create multiple identical pieces for a wider distribution or sale.

### File formats

OBJ (Wavefront Object),	FBX,	DAE (COLLADA).

### Materials

PETG, PLA, TPU, Wood
