Our team of experienced curators carefully selects and reviews each piece of artwork, ensuring that it meets our high standards for creativity, technical proficiency, and artistic vision.

# General overview

As part of our curation process, we review the profiles of each artist whose work we consider for exhibition. This includes assessing their experience and background in generative art, as well as their overall artistic vision and aesthetic style. We believe that understanding the artist behind the artwork is essential to creating a rich and engaging exhibition experience for our audience.

In addition to artist profiles, we also carefully audit the creative source code used in each piece of artwork. This involves reviewing the code to ensure that it is well-structured, well-documented, and follows best practices for coding style and standards. We also test the code in a controlled environment to ensure that it is functioning as intended, and that it does not contain any errors or vulnerabilities that could compromise the security or integrity of the artwork.

Our curation service is dedicated to promoting and advancing the field of generative art, and we are committed to showcasing the best and most innovative works from around the world. By carefully reviewing and auditing each piece of artwork, we ensure that our exhibitions are of the highest quality and offer a unique and engaging experience for our audience.

## Curation methods

1. Technical proficiency: Generative art often involves complex technical processes, and curators must be able to evaluate the technical proficiency of the artwork being considered. This includes assessing the quality and complexity of the code used to generate the artwork, as well as the technical skill and experience of the artist.

2. Artistic vision: Generative art is first and foremost an artistic practice, and curators must be able to evaluate the artistic vision and aesthetic quality of the artwork being considered. This includes assessing the originality, creativity, and innovation of the work, as well as its ability to communicate ideas and emotions.

3. Cohesiveness: A successful generative art exhibition should be cohesive and engaging, and curators must be able to select works that fit together thematically and aesthetically. This includes assessing how individual works will fit together as part of the larger exhibition, as well as how the exhibition as a whole will engage and inspire the audience.
